We have started to arrange urban sketching around Hull to record Hull City of Culture. If you are interested let us know or just turn up. We would also like to invite [Yorkshire Urban Sketchers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/urbansketchersyorkshire/ 'Yorkshire Urban Sketchers Facebook group') to join us.

These sessions are not just for the Hull Art Circle group, so if you would like to sketch with us, please come along.

* Next session—**Thursday 16 March**, meeting at [Queen Victoria Square, Hull](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Queen+Victoria+Square/@53.7437239,-0.3391258,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x4c526d9906d88560!8m2!3d53.7437239!4d-0.3391258 'Google map of Queen Victoria Square, Hull'), 10—11.30am.
