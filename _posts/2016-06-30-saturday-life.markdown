### Parking

There is ample off-road parking. Spaces available at the back, side and front of the venue. If cars are parked with a bit of forethought I have been assured that up to 16 can be accommodated. If you need to block another car in this shouldn’t cause problems as we are the only group booked in that will be using the car park.  Street parking is very limited and is for 1 hour only – no return for two hours.


Please allow yourself enough time to set-up (and find the kitchen/toilets/have a drink) so we are all ready for a 1pm start. Participants can break for a drink whenever they choose. There is a small private garden off the room that we can use.

#### Refreshments

£1.00 payment per sessions entitles you to as many cups of tea, coffee and cakes, biscuits as you need!

#### What to bring

Please bring all materials (including paper, canvases, drawing /painting media) as well as an easel. please note there are plenty of chairs to make a drawing 'donkey'.
