### Evening meetings

We meet at our studios at 6:45pm on every Monday and Wednesday evening. We offer no tuition, but we always have a portrait model, and occasionally, once a month a life model.

### Daytime meetings — open all all

We also have a daytime life drawing session, again once a month. This morning session (10:30am—12:30pm) is open to non-members. There is an additional cost of £5 per session to cover the room hire.

### Studio locations

We meet at two different locations—the old Endeavour High School on Beverley Road for Monday evenings, and the Methodist Church Hall in Hessle each Wednesday ([details](/contact/))

### Model fees

Paid models are £1.50 per session, or £2.00 for a life model. (Volunteers are very welcome too. Please [get in touch](/contact/) if you'd like to sit for us).

### Programme

* Meetings are on Monday and Wednesday evenings (6:45pm—8:45pm)
* Monthly daytime sessions on a Tuesday (10:30am—12:30pm)
