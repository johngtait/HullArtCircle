We meet at our studio at 6:45pm on every Monday and Wednesday evening. We offer no tuition, but we always have a portrait model, and occasionally, once a month a life model.

The studio is in NAPA on Anlaby Road, the former College of Arts and Crafts (next to the former Tower Cinema). The studio is equipped with easels and donkeys, and we have a secure storage cupboard.

We also have a day-time life drawing session, again once a month. This morning session is open to non-members. There is an additional cost of £5 per session to cover the room hire.

## Model fees

Paid models are £1.50 per session, or £2.00 for a life model. (Volunteers are very welcome too. Please [get in touch](/contact/) if you'd like to sit for us).

## Programme

* Meetings are on Monday and Wednesday evenings (6:45pm—8:45pm)

## Periods of closure

The studio is closed during term time holidays. During August we sometimes find alternative accommodation for a few weeks.
